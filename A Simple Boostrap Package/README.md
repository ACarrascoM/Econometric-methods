# A Simple Boostrap Package

The files shows how to apply different bootstrap techniques to different data structure using MATLAB. 
It is worth making some general observations about the utility of these functions: a) they deal with multivariate data, 
b) some of them necessarily needs specific data arrangement, the following examples show the way we can construct these objects, 
c) the package includes a function to compute kernel density and cumulative distribution estimators (mykernel.m) for 
\textit{multivariate data} which is extremely useful in non-parametric smoothed bootstrap, d) bootstrapping is performed with a 
reasonable low computational cost, e) each function has its own documentation, and 
f) I have tried to test the codes in several ways and can be applied to a wide range of econometric models, however, 
there could be some bugs that I have not found yet so if you find some, please contact me.
